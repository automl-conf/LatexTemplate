\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Create with \verb|\begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}|.
\end{abstract}

The \texttt{automl} package provides a \LaTeX{} style for the AutoML Conference.
This document provides some notes regarding the package and tips for typesetting
manuscripts. The package and this document is maintained at the following GitHub
repository:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://github.com/automl-conf/LatexTemplate}
\end{center}
Users are encouraged to submit issues, bug reports, etc.\ to:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://github.com/automl-conf/LatexTemplate/issues}
\end{center}
A barebones submission is also available as \texttt{barebones\_submission\_template.tex} in the same
repository.

\section{Package options}

With no options, the \texttt{automl} package prepares an anonymized manuscript
with hidden supplemental material. Two options are supported changing this
behavior:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{final} -- produces non-anonymized camera-ready version for
  distribution and/or publication in the main conference track
\item \texttt{finalworkshop} -- produces non-anonymized camera-ready version for
  distribution and/or publication in the workshop track
\item \texttt{hidesupplement} -- hides supplementary material (following
  \verb|\appendix|); for example, for submitting or distributing the main paper
  without supplement
\end{itemize}
Note that \texttt{final} or \texttt{finalworkshop} may be used in combination
with \texttt{hidesupplement} to prepare a non-anonymized version of the main
paper with hidden supplement.

\section{Supplemental material}

Please provide supplemental material in the main document. You may begin the
supplemental material using \verb|\appendix|. Any content following this command
will be suppressed in the final output if the \texttt{hidesupplement} option is
given.

\section{Note regarding line numbering at submission time}

To ensure that line numbering works correctly with display math mode, please do
\emph{not} use \TeX{} primitives such as \verb|$$| and \texttt{eqnarray}.  (Using
these is not good practice anyway.)%
%
\footnote{\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/196/eqnarray-vs-align}}%
\footnote{\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503/why-is-preferable-to}}
%
Please use \LaTeX{} equivalents such as \verb|\[ ... \]| (or
\verb|\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}|) and the \texttt{align} environment
from the \texttt{amsmath} package.%
%
\footnote{\url{http://tug.ctan.org/info/short-math-guide/short-math-guide.pdf}}

\section{References}

Authors may use any citation style as long as it is consistent throughout the
document. By default we propose author--year citations. Code is provided in the
preamble to achieve such citations using either \texttt{natbib/bibtex} or the
more modern \texttt{biblatex/biber}.

You may create a parenthetical reference with \verb|\citep|, such as appears at
the end of this sentence \citep{example_book}.  You may create a textual
reference using \verb|\citet|, as \citet{example_book} also demonstrated.

\section{Tables}

We recommend the \texttt{booktabs} package for creating tables, as demonstrated
in Table \ref{example_table}. Note that table captions appear \emph{above} tables.

\begin{table}
  \caption{An example table using the \texttt{booktabs} package.}
  \label{example_table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lrr}
    \toprule
    & \multicolumn{2}{c}{metric} \\
    \cmidrule{2-3}
    method & accuracy & time \\
    \midrule
    baseline & 10 & 100 \\
    our method & \textbf{100} & \textbf{10} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Figures and subfigures}

The \texttt{automl} style loads the \texttt{subcaption} package, which may be
used to create and caption subfigures. Please note that this is
\emph{incompatible} with the (obsolete and deprecated) \texttt{subfigure}
package. A figure with subfigures is demonstrated in Figure
\ref{example_figure}. Note that figure captions appear \emph{below} figures.

Please ensure that all text appearing in figures (axis labels, legends, etc.)
is legible.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
    \centering
    \framebox{Amazing figure!}
    \caption{Subfigure caption.}
    \label{example_figure_left}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
    \centering
    \framebox{Another amazing figure!}
    \caption{Another subfigure caption.}
    \label{example_figure_right}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{An example figure with subfigures. \subref{example_figure_left}: an
    amazing figure. \subref{example_figure_right}: another amazing figure.}
  \label{example_figure}
\end{figure}

\section{Pseudocode}
\label{sec:code}

To add pseudocode, you may make use of any package you see fit -- the
\texttt{automl} package should be compatible with any of them. In particular,
you may want to check out the \texttt{algorithm2e}%
%
\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/algorithm2e}}
%
and/or the \texttt{algorithmicx}%
%
\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx}}
%
packages, both of which can produce nicely typeset pseudocode. You may also wish
to load the \texttt{algorithm}%
%
\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/algorithms}}
%
package, which creates an \texttt{algorithm} floating environment you can access
with \verb|\begin{algorithm} ... \end{algorithm}|. This environment supports
\verb|\caption{}|, \verb|\label{}| and \verb|\ref{}|, etc.

\section{Adding acknowledgments}

You may add acknowledgments of funding, etc.\ using the \texttt{acknowledgments}
environment. Acknowledgments will be automatically commented out at submission
time. An example is given below in the source code for this document; it will be
hidden in the \textsc{pdf} unless the \texttt{final} or \texttt{finalworkshop}
option is given.

\section{Required Material}

All submissions must include a discussion on limitations and a broader impact
statement; and a \textbf{Reproducibility Checklist} in their manuscripts, both
at submission and camera-ready time.
The discussion of limitations and broader impact is part of the 9 pages allocated
to the main paper (there is no page limitation for references and appendices), while
the reproducibility checklist is not.

\section{Limitations and Broader Impact Statement}

The 9 pages allocated for the main paper must include a discussion of limitations
and a broader impact statement regarding the approach, datasets and applications
proposed/used in your paper. It should reflect on the environmental, ethical and
societal implications of your work. The statement should require at most one page
and must be included both at submission and camera-ready time.

This section is included in the template as a default, but you can also place these
discussions anywhere else in the main paper, e.g., in the introduction/future work.

The Centre for the Governance of AI has written an excellent guide for writing
good broader impact statements (for the NeurIPS conference) that may be a useful
resource for AutoML-Conf authors.%

\section{Reproducibility Checklist}

All authors must include a section with the AutoML-Conf \textbf{Reproducibility
Checklist} in their manuscripts, both at submission and camera-ready time.
The reproducibility checklist is a combination of the
%
\href{https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/PaperChecklist}
     {NeurIPS '21 checklist}
%
and the
\href{https://www.automl.org/wp-content/uploads/NAS/NAS_checklist.pdf}
     {\textsc{nas} checklist}.
%
For each question, change the default \verb|\answerTODO{}| (typeset \answerTODO)
to
\verb|\answerYes{[justification]}| (typeset \answerYes),
\verb|\answerNo{[justification]}| (typeset \answerNo), or
\verb|\answerNA{[justification]}| (typeset \answerNA).
\textbf{You must include a brief justification to your answer,} either by
referencing the appropriate section of your paper or providing a brief inline
description.  For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item Did you include the license of the code and datasets? \answerYes{See
  Section~\ref{sec:code}.}
\item Did you include all the code for running experiments? \answerNo{We include
  the code we wrote, but it depends on proprietary libraries for executing on a
  compute cluster and as such will not be runnable without modifications. We
  also include a runnable sequential version of the code that we also report
  experiments in the paper with.}
\item Did you include the license of the datasets? \answerNA{Our experiments
  were conducted on publicly available datasets and we have not introduced new
  datasets.}
\end{itemize}
Please note that if you answer a question with \verb|\answerNo{}|, we expect
that you compensate for it (e.g., if you cannot provide the full evaluation
code, you should at least provide code for a minimal reproduction of the main
insights of your paper).

Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
answers. Note that this section does not count towards the page limit. In your
paper, please delete this instructions block and only keep the Checklist section
heading above along with the questions/answers below.
