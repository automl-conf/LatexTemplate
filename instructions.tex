\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Create with \verb|\begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}|.
\end{abstract}

The \texttt{automl} package provides a \LaTeX{} style for the AutoML conference.
This document provides some notes regarding the package and tips for typesetting
manuscripts. The package and this document is maintained at the following GitHub
repository:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://github.com/automl-conf/LatexTemplate}
\end{center}
Users are encouraged to submit issues, bug reports, etc.\ to:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://github.com/automl-conf/LatexTemplate/issues}
\end{center}

A barebones submission is also available as
\texttt{barebones\_submission\_template.tex} in the same repository.

\section{Package Options}

With no options, the \texttt{automl} package prepares an anonymized manuscript
ready for submission to any track of the main conference (i.e., the methods or
\textsc{abcd} tracks for AutoML 2025). Several options are supported changing
this behavior:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{revealauthors} -- produces a non-anonymized manuscript for
  single-blind submission, e.g. to the ABCD track
\item \texttt{shortpaper} -- produces a manuscript for submission and/or
  publication in the non-archival track
\item \texttt{preprint} -- produces a non-anonymized manuscript for
  preliminary (i.e., pre-acceptance) distribution, e.g. in arXiv
\item \texttt{final} -- produces a non-anonymized manuscript for distribution
  and/or publication in the proceedings
\item \texttt{hidesupplement} -- hides supplementary material (following
  \verb|\appendix|); for example, for submitting or distributing the main paper
  without supplement
\end{itemize}
These options may be combined. For example, \texttt{final} or \texttt{shortpaper}
may be used together to create a camera-ready manuscript for the non-archival track,
and \texttt{hidesupplement} can be used in combination with any other flags to
hide the supplemental material.

\section{Supplemental Material}

Please provide supplemental material in the main document. You may begin the
supplemental material using \verb|\appendix|. Any content following this command
will be suppressed in the final output if the \texttt{hidesupplement} option is
given.

\section{Note Regarding Line Numbering at Submission Time}

To ensure that line numbering works correctly with display math mode, please do
\emph{not} use \TeX{} primitives such as \verb|$$| and \texttt{eqnarray}.  (Using
these is not good practice anyway.)%
%
\footnote{\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/196/eqnarray-vs-align}}%
\footnote{\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503/why-is-preferable-to}}
%
Please use \LaTeX{} equivalents such as \verb|\[ ... \]| (or
\verb|\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}|) and the \texttt{align} environment
from the \texttt{amsmath} package.%
%
\footnote{\url{http://tug.ctan.org/info/short-math-guide/short-math-guide.pdf}}

\section{References}

Authors may use any citation style as long as it is consistent throughout the
document. By default we propose author--year citations. Code is provided in the
preamble to achieve such citations using either \texttt{natbib/bibtex} or the
more modern \texttt{biblatex/biber}.

You may create a parenthetical reference with \verb|\citep|, such as appears at
the end of this sentence \citep{example_book}.  You may create a textual
reference using \verb|\citet|, as \citet{example_book} also demonstrated.

\section{Tables}

We recommend the \texttt{booktabs} package for creating tables, as demonstrated
in Table \ref{example_table}.

Table captions should appear \emph{above} tables.

\begin{table}
  \caption{An example table using the \texttt{booktabs} package.}
  \label{example_table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lrr}
    \toprule
    & \multicolumn{2}{c}{metric} \\
    \cmidrule{2-3}
    method & accuracy & time \\
    \midrule
    baseline & 10 & 100 \\
    our method & \textbf{100} & \textbf{10} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Figures and Subfigures}

The \texttt{automl} style loads the \texttt{subcaption} package, which may be
used to create and caption subfigures. Please note that this is
\emph{incompatible} with the (obsolete and deprecated) \texttt{subfigure}
package. A figure with subfigures is demonstrated in Figure
\ref{example_figure}.

Figure captions should appear \emph{below} figures.

Please ensure that all text appearing in figures (axis labels, legends, etc.)
is legible.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
    \centering
    \framebox{Amazing figure!}
    \caption{Subfigure caption.}
    \label{example_figure_left}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
    \centering
    \framebox{Another amazing figure!}
    \caption{Another subfigure caption.}
    \label{example_figure_right}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{An example figure with subfigures. \subref{example_figure_left}: an
    amazing figure. \subref{example_figure_right}: another amazing figure.}
  \label{example_figure}
\end{figure}

\section{Pseudocode}
\label{sec:code}

To add pseudocode, you may make use of any package you see fit -- the
\texttt{automl} package should be compatible with any of them. In particular,
you may want to check out the \texttt{algorithm2e}%
%
\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/algorithm2e}}
%
and/or the \texttt{algorithmicx}%
%
\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx}}
%
packages, both of which can produce nicely typeset pseudocode. You may also wish
to load the \texttt{algorithm}%
%
\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/algorithms}}
%
package, which creates an \texttt{algorithm} floating environment you can access
with \verb|\begin{algorithm} ... \end{algorithm}|. This environment supports
\verb|\caption{}|, \verb|\label{}| and \verb|\ref{}|, etc.

\section{Adding Acknowledgments}

You may add acknowledgments of funding, etc.\ using the \texttt{acknowledgments}
environment. Acknowledgments will be automatically commented out in anonymized
manuscripts (that is, if the \texttt{final} or \texttt{preprint} options are not
given). An example is given below in the source code for this document; it will
be hidden in the \textsc{pdf} unless the \texttt{final} option is given.

\section{Required Material}

All submissions must include a broader impact statement and a
\textbf{Reproducibility Checklist} in their manuscripts, both at submission and
camera-ready time.  The discussion of limitations and broader impact is part of
the 9 pages allocated to the main paper (there is no page limitation for
references and appendices), while the reproducibility checklist is not.

\section{Broader Impact Statement}

The 9 pages allocated for the main paper must include a broader impact statement
regarding the approach, datasets and applications proposed/used in your
paper. It should reflect on the environmental, ethical and societal implications
of your work. The statement should require at most one page and must be included
both at submission and camera-ready time.

If authors have reflected on their work and determined that there are no likely
negative broader impacts, they may use the following statement:

\begin{displayquote}
  After careful reflection, the authors have determined that this work presents no notable
  negative impacts to society or the environment.
\end{displayquote}

A standalone section for the broader impact statement is included in the
template by default, but you can also place this discussion anywhere else in the
paper, e.g., in the introduction or a future work section.

The Centre for the Governance of AI has written an excellent guide for writing
good broader impact statements (for the NeurIPS conference) that may be a useful
resource for AutoML authors.%

\section*{Submission Checklist}
All submissions must include a section containing the AutoML submission
checklist, shown below. The submission checklist does not count towards the page
limit and must be included at submission and camera-ready time.  The submission
checklist draws upon related submission checklists:
%
\href{https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/PaperChecklist}
     {the NeurIPS '22 checklist}
%
and the
\href{https://www.automl.org/wp-content/uploads/NAS/NAS_checklist.pdf}
     {\textsc{nas} checklist}.
%

For each question, change the default \verb|\answerTODO{}| (typeset \answerTODO)
to
\verb|\answerYes{[justification]}| (typeset \answerYes),
\verb|\answerNo{[justification]}| (typeset \answerNo), or
\verb|\answerNA{[justification]}| (typeset \answerNA).
\textbf{You must include a brief justification to your answer,} either by
referencing the appropriate section of your paper or providing a brief inline
description.  For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item Did you include the license of the code and datasets? \answerYes{See
  Section~\ref{sec:code}.}
\item Did you include all the code for running experiments? \answerNo{We include
  the code we wrote for conducting the experiments, but complete replication
  depends on proprietary libraries for executing on a private compute
  cluster. The code therefore is not runnable without modification. To
  compensate, we provide a runnable but non-parallelized version of the code
  that could replicate the results at the expense of a greater wall-clock time.}
\item Did you include the license of the datasets? \answerNA{Our experiments
  were conducted on publicly available datasets and we have not introduced new
  datasets.}
\end{itemize}
Please note that if you answer a question with \verb|\answerNo{}|, we expect
that you provide an explanation and/or compensation for the omission. For
example, if you cannot provide complete evaluation code for some reason, you
might instead provide code for a minimal reproduction of the main insights of
your paper.

Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
answers. Note that the submission checklist does not count towards the page
limit. If you choose to modify \texttt{instructions.tex}, please delete these
instructions and only keep the Submission Checklist section heading above along
with the questions/answers below.
