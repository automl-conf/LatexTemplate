% With no package options, the submission will be anonymized, the supplemental
% material will be visible, and line numbers will be added to the manuscript.
%
% To compile a non-anonymized camera-ready version, add the [final] option:
%
% \usepackage[final]{automl}
%
% To compile for the non-archival content track, add the [shortpaper] option:
%
% \usepackage[shortpaper]{automl}
% \usepackage[final,shortpaper]{automl}
%
% To compile a single-blind submission, e.g. for the ABCD track, add the
% [revealauthors] option:
%
% \usepackage[revealauthors]{automl}
%
% To compile a non-anonymized pre-print version that can be uploaded to arXiv,
% add the [preprint] option:
%
% \usepackage[preprint]{automl}
%
% The [hidesupplement] option may be used to hide the supplementary material from any of the
% above commands, e.g.:
%
% \usepackage[hidesupplement,final,shortpaper]{automl}

% natbib you may use:

\usepackage{natbib}

% The syntax for adding an author is
%
% \author[i]{\nameemail{author name}{author email}}
%
% where i is an affiliation counter. Authors may have
% multiple affiliations; e.g.:
%
% \author[1,2]{\nameemail{Anonymous}{anonymous@example.com}}

\author[1]{\nameemail{Author 1}{email1@example.com}}

% the list might continue:
% \author[2,3]{\nameemail{Author 2}{email2@example.com}}
% \author[3]{\nameemail{Author 3}{email3@example.com}}

% if you need to force a linebreak in the author list, prepend an \author entry
% with \\:

% \author[1,2,3]{\\\nameemail{Author 4}{email5@example.com}}

% Specify corresponding affiliations after authors, referring to counter used in
% \author:

\affil[1]{Institution 1}

% the list might continue:
% \affil[2]{Institution 2}
% \affil[3]{Institution 3}
%
% this system may also be used to add additional footnotes, e.g. to indicate
% equal contributions. Here is an example:
%
% \author[1,$\ast$]{\nameemail{Author 1}{email1@example.com}}
% \author[1,$\ast$]{\nameemail{Author 2}{email2@example.com}}
% \author[2]{\nameemail{Author 3}{email3@example.com}}
%
% \affil[1]{Institution 1}
% \affil[2]{Institution 2}
% \affil[$\ast$]{Equal contribution.}
