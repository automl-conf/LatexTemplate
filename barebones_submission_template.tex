\title{Example Submission for AutoML 2023}

% The syntax for adding an author is
%
% \author[i]{\nameemail{author name}{author email}}
%
% where i is an affiliation counter. Authors may have
% multiple affiliations; e.g.:
%
% \author[1,2]{\nameemail{Anonymous}{anonymous@example.com}}

\author[1]{\nameemail{Author 1}{email1@example.com}}

% the list might continue:
% \author[2,3]{\nameemail{Author 2}{email2@example.com}}
% \author[3]{\nameemail{Author 3}{email3@example.com}}
% \author[4]{\nameemail{Author 4}{email4@example.com}}

% if you need to force a linebreak in the author list, prepend an \author entry
% with \\:

% \author[3]{\\\nameemail{Author 5}{email5@example.com}}

% Specify corresponding affiliations after authors, referring to counter used in
% \author:

\affil[1]{Institution 1}

% the list might continue:
% \affil[2]{Institution 2}
% \affil[3]{Institution 3}
% \affil[4]{Institution 4}
%
% this system may also be used to add additional footnotes, e.g. to indciate
% equal contributions. Here is an example:
%
% \author[1,$\ast$]{\nameemail{Author 1}{email1@example.com}}
% \author[1,$\ast$]{\nameemail{Author 2}{email2@example.com}}
% \author[2]{\nameemail{Author 3}{email3@example.com}}

\section{Broader Impact Statement}

% The 9 pages allocated for the main paper must include a broader impact
% statement regarding the approach, datasets and applications proposed/used in
% your paper. It should reflect on the environmental, ethical and societal
% implications of your work. The statement should require at most one page and
% must be included both at submission and camera-ready time.
%
% If authors have reflected on their work and determined that there are no
% likely negative broader impacts, they may use the following statement:
%
% After careful reflection, the authors have determined that this work presents
% no notable negative impacts to society or the environment.
%
% This section is included in the template as a default, but you can also place these
% discussions anywhere else in the main paper, e.g., in the introduction/future work.
%
% The Centre for the Governance of AI has written an excellent guide for writing
% good broader impact statements (for the NeurIPS conference) that may be a
% useful resource for AutoML-Conf authors:

\section{Submission Checklist}

% The submission checklist is a combination of the NeurIPS '21 checklist:
%
%   https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/PaperChecklist
%
% and the NAS checklist:
%
%   https://www.automl.org/wp-content/uploads/NAS/NAS_checklist.pdf
%
% For each question, change the default \answerTODO{} to either:
%
%     \answerYes{[justification]},
%     \answerNo{[justification]}, or
%     \answerNA{[justification]}.
%
% *You must include a brief justification to your answer,* either by
% referencing the appropriate section of your paper or providing a brief inline
% description.  For example:
%
% - Did you include the license of the code and datasets?
%   \answerYes{See Section~\ref{sec:code}.}
%
% - Did you include all the code for running experiments?
%   \answerNo{We include the code we wrote, but it depends on proprietary
%   libraries for executing on a compute cluster and as such will not be
%   runnable without modifications. We also include a runnable sequential
%   version of the code that we also report experiments in the paper with.}
%
% - Did you include the license of the datasets?
%   \answerNA{Our experiments were conducted on publicly available datasets and
%   we did not introduce new datasets.}
%
% Please note that if you answer a question with \answerNo{}, we expect that you
% compensate for it (e.g., if you cannot provide the full evaluation code, you
% should at least provide code for a minimal reproduction of the main insights
% of your paper).
%
% Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
% answers. Note that this section does not count towards the page limit.
