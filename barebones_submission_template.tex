% The syntax for adding an author is
%
% \author[i]{\nameemail{author name}{author email}}
%
% where i is an affiliation counter. Authors may have
% multiple affiliations; e.g.:
%
% \author[1,2]{\nameemail{Anonymous}{anonymous@example.com}}

\author[1]{\nameemail{Author 1}{email1@example.com}}

% the list might continue:
% \author[2,3]{\nameemail{Author 2}{email2@example.com}}
% \author[3]{\nameemail{Author 3}{email3@example.com}}

% if you need to force a linebreak in the author list, prepend an \author entry
% with \\:

% \author[1,2,3]{\\\nameemail{Author 4}{email5@example.com}}

% Specify corresponding affiliations after authors, referring to counter used in
% \author:

\affil[1]{Institution 1}

% the list might continue:
% \affil[2]{Institution 2}
% \affil[3]{Institution 3}
%
% this system may also be used to add additional footnotes, e.g. to indicate
% equal contributions. Here is an example:
%
% \author[1,$\ast$]{\nameemail{Author 1}{email1@example.com}}
% \author[1,$\ast$]{\nameemail{Author 2}{email2@example.com}}
% \author[2]{\nameemail{Author 3}{email3@example.com}}

% ==== Formatting Instructions
% The page limit for the main paper is 9 pages; this includes the broader impact
% statement but not the submission checklist, references, or appendix.
% The broader impact statement and submission checklist are mandatory at both
% submission time and in the camera ready. References and supplemental materials
% are not limited in length. Accepted papers will be allowed to add an additional page
% of content to the main paper to react to reviewer feedback.
% This additional content may in fact be added during the rebuttal phase as authors
% interact with the reviewers to ensure acceptance decisions can be made regarding
% near-camera-ready work.

\section{Example Section}
% This example section may be removed.

\section{Broader Impact Statement}
% The 9 pages allocated for the main paper must include a broader impact
% statement regarding the approach, datasets and applications proposed/used in
% your paper. It should reflect on the environmental, ethical and societal
% implications of your work. The statement should require at most one page and
% must be included both at submission and camera-ready time.
%
% If authors have reflected on their work and determined that there are no
% likely negative broader impacts, they may use the following statement:
%
% After careful reflection, the authors have determined that this work presents
% no notable negative impacts to society or the environment.
%
% This section is included in the template as a default, but you can also place these
% discussions anywhere else in the main paper, e.g., in the introduction/future work.
%
% The Centre for the Governance of AI has written an excellent guide for writing
% good broader impact statements (for the NeurIPS conference) that may be a
% useful resource for AutoML-Conf authors:

\section*{Submission Checklist}

% All submissions must include a section containing the AutoML submission
% checklist, shown below. The submission checklist does not count towards the
% page limit and must be included at submission and camera-ready time.  The
% submission checklist draws upon related submission checklists:
%
% the NeurIPS '22 checklist: https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/PaperChecklist
%     and the NAS checklist: https://www.automl.org/wp-content/uploads/NAS/NAS_checklist.pdf
%
% For each question, change the default \answerTODO{} to either:
%
%     \answerYes{[justification]},
%     \answerNo{[justification]}, or
%     \answerNA{[justification]}.

% *You must include a brief justification to your answer,} either by referencing
% *the appropriate section of your paper or providing a brief inline
% *description.* For example:
%
% -  Did you include the license of the code and datasets?
%
%    \answerYes{See Section~\ref{sec:code}.
%
% - Did you include all the code for running experiments?
%
%   \answerNo{We include the code we wrote for conducting the experiments, but
%   complete replication depends on proprietary libraries for executing on a
%   private compute cluster. The code therefore is not runnable without
%   modification. To compensate, we provide a runnable but non-parallelized
%   version of the code that could replicate the results at the expense of a
%   greater wall-clock time.}
%
% - Did you include the license of the datasets?
%
%   \answerNA{Our experiments were conducted on publicly available datasets and
%   we have not introduced new datasets.}
%
% Please note that if you answer a question with \verb|\answerNo{}|, we expect
% that you provide an explanation and/or compensation for the omission. For
% example, if you cannot provide complete evaluation code for some reason, you
% might instead provide code for a minimal reproduction of the main insights of
% your paper.
%
% Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
% answers. Note that the submission checklist does not count towards the page
% limit.
